I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Statistics as a [Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship/) and a [SEED Honors Scholar](https://seedscholars.berkeley.edu/home). My current experiences and interests lie in the applications of CS and Stats to public/global health through research. I hope to utilize my computational and data analysis skills to advocate for equitable access to infectious disease treatment and prevention.
