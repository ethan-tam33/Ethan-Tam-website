Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name's Ethan, and I'm a first-year undergraduate student studying at UC Berkeley. My current experiences and interests lie in the intersection of computer science and statistics, specifically in applications to solving real-world problems. Whether in industry or research, I work collaboratively to build new ideas and to seek innovative solutions.
